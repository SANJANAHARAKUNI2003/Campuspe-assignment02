Gen-ai Assignment 02

Name : Sanjana Pralhad Harakuni

Description : This repository contains solutions for all 20 programming questions
Each question has been carefully analyzed, and the solutions are implemented with:

->Proper variable naming conventions of readability
->Clear and concise comments explaining the logic
->Step by step Approach starting from simpler to complex problems
->Handling edge cases and user inputs (using try-except block)
->Bonus features are also implemented(eg: best score tracking in Number Guessing Game, in Q11.added 3 more creative patterns)

Questions Attempted:
Q1- Personal Bio Card 
Q2- Simple Calculator 
Q3- String Manipulator 
Q4- Age Calculator 
Q5- Bill Splitter 
Q6- Grade Calculator 
Q7- Temperature Converter
Q8- Leap Year Checker 
Q9- Ticket Pricing System 
Q10- Simple ATM Simulator 
Q11- Number Pattern Printer
Q12- Multiplication Table Generator
Q13- Sum and Average Calculator 
Q14- Factorial Calculator 
Q15- Prime Number Checker 
Q16- Number Guessing Game 
Q17- Palindrome Checker 
Q18- Calculator Functions 
Q19- Text Analysis Functions
Q20- Number System Functions

Specific instructions :
-> All questions were carefully analyzed before coding 
-> Started with easier questions to gradually approach harder problem
-> Simple python coding (covering basic concepts variables,loops , conditions, functions, lists) with clarity and human readabiliity
-> gained clarity on git hub commands as well 
-> Exception cases are handled carefully 

Challenges faced:
-> Hard questions took a lot time to get proper output , referred python materials  and geeks-for-geeks for syntax
-> Testing with various inputs and debugging so that they dont crash with wrong or empty inputs but eventually i got better at it
-> Was bit confuesd with implementing nested loops and try except block , still need bit more practice 

how to Run:
-> Open the respective python file for the question you want to run
-> Run it in any python environment (command : python followed by "file name")
-> Follow the on-screen prompts (terminal) to interact with the program
